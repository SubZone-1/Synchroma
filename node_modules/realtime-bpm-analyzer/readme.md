Welcome to Realtime BPM Analyzer, a powerful and easy-to-use TypeScript/JavaScript library for detecting the beats-per-minute (BPM) of an audio or video source in real-time.

## Getting started

To install this module to your project, just launch the command below:

```bash
npm install realtime-bpm-analyzer
```

To learn more about how to use the library, you can check out [the documentation](https://dlepaux.github.io/realtime-bpm-analyzer).

## Features

- **Dependency-free** library that utilizes the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) to analyze audio or video sources and provide accurate BPM detection.
- Can be used to analyze **audio or video** nodes, streams as well as **files**.
- Allows you to compute the BPM while the audio or video is playing.
- Lightweight and easy to use, making it a great option for web-based music production and DJing applications.

## Usages

If you encounter issues along the way, remember we have a [discord server](https://discord.gg/3xV7TGmq) and a [chat](https://gitter.im/realtime-bpm-analyzer/Lobby) !

### Realtime (stream/playing) strategy

Mesure or detect the BPM from a **stream** or a **player** ? Meaning that it is technically a stream. The library provide an `AudioWorkletProcessor` that will compute BPM while the stream is distributed.

This example shows how to deal with a simple `audio` node.

1. An [AudioNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioNode) to analyze. So something like this:
```html
<audio src="./new_order-blue_monday.mp3" id="track"></audio>
```

2. Create the AudioWorkletProcessor with `createRealTimeBpmProcessor`, create and pipe the lowpass filter to the AudioWorkletNode (`realtimeAnalyzerNode`).
```javascript
import { createRealTimeBpmProcessor } from 'realtime-bpm-analyzer';

const realtimeAnalyzerNode = await createRealTimeBpmProcessor(audioContext);

// Set the source with the HTML Audio Node
const track = document.getElementById('track');
const source = audioContext.createMediaElementSource(track);

// Lowpass filter
const filter = audioContext.createBiquadFilter();
filter.type = 'lowpass';

// Connect stuff together
source.connect(filter).connect(realtimeAnalyzerNode);
source.connect(audioContext.destination);

realtimeAnalyzerNode.port.onmessage = (event) => {
  if (event.data.message === 'BPM') {
    console.log('BPM', event.data.result);
  }
  if (event.data.message === 'BPM_STABLE') {
    console.log('BPM_STABLE', event.data.result);
  }
};
```

3. You also need to expose the file `dist/realtime-bpm-processor.js` (already bundled) to your public root diretory. Typically, this file must be available at http://yourdomain/realtime-bpm-processor.js.
```javascript
// For NextJS see your next.config.js and add this:
// You also need to install `npm install copy-webpack-plugin@6.4.1 -D`
// Note that the latest version (11.0.0) didn't worked properly with NextJS 12
const path = require('path');
const CopyPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');
module.exports = {
  webpack: config => {
    config.plugins.push(
      new CopyPlugin({
        patterns: [
          {
            from: './node_modules/realtime-bpm-analyzer/dist/realtime-bpm-processor.js',
            to: path.resolve(__dirname, 'public'),
          },
        ],
      },
      ));

    return config;
  },
};
```

### Local/Offline strategy

Analyze the BPM from **files** located in your **desktop, tablet or mobile** !

1. Import the library
```javascript
import * as realtimeBpm from 'realtime-bpm-analyzer';
```

2. Use an `input[type=file]` to get the files you want.
```jsx
<input type="file" accept="wav,mp3" onChange={event => this.onFileChange(event)}/>
```

3. You can listen the `change` event like so, and analyze the BPM of the selected files. You don't need to be connected to Internet for this to work.
```javascript
function onFileChange(event) {
  // Get the first file from the list
  const file = event.target.files[0];
  const reader = new FileReader();
  reader.addEventListener('load', () => {
    const audioContext = new window.AudioContext();
    // The file is uploaded, now we decode it
    audioContext.decodeAudioData(reader.result, audioBuffer => {
      // The result is passed to the analyzer
      realtimeBpm.analyzeFullBuffer(audioBuffer).then(topCandidates => {
        // Do something with the BPM
        console.log('topCandidates', topCandidates);
      });
    });
  });
  reader.readAsArrayBuffer(file);
};
```

## Roadmap

[] Add confidence level of Tempo
[] Combine Amplitude Thresholding strategy with others to improve BPM accuracy
[] Improve the continous analysis in order to ignore drops and cuts, monitore memory usage

Let us know what is your most wanted feature by opening [an issue](https://github.com/dlepaux/realtime-bpm-analyzer/issues).

## Development

The test suite is built on top of karma and is very practical to test new features. Before running tests switch the `singleRun` property of `karma.config.js` to leave the browser open after the tests.

```bash
npm install
npm run prepare
npm test
```

## Tests & Coverage

To launch the test suite, just launch the command below:

```bash
npm test
open http://localhost:9876
```

Note that tests requires real human gesture to be successfully run!

## Credits

This library was inspired by the [Tornqvist project](https://github.com/tornqvist/bpm-detective), which was also based on [Joe Sullivan's algorithm](http://joesul.li/van/beat-detection-using-web-audio/). Thank you to both of them.
