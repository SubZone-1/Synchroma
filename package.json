  "description": "Synchroma is a web-based audio visualizer that displays different visual changes in the background of the page, in order to obtain a strobe light effect. It has the ability to sync the strobe triggers with different frequency ranges that are picked up by the microphone of the device on which the platform is running. It also has a manual mode, allowing the user to have full control over the parameters that control the strobe triggers. Synchroma is meant to be compatible with all types of devices, regardless of operating system or platform.",
